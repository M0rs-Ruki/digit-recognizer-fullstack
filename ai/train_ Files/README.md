# Digit Recognition Neural Network

This project implements a neural network for handwritten digit recognition using the MNIST dataset. The network uses a simple feedforward architecture with one hidden layer, and the activation functions include ReLU for the hidden layer and softmax for the output layer.

## Overview

The goal of this project is to create a neural network model that can accurately predict digits (0-9) based on images of handwritten digits. The dataset used is the MNIST dataset, which consists of 28x28 grayscale images of handwritten digits.

## Data
The dataset used in this project is the MNIST dataset.
